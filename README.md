# Project: Microarray Leukemia Classification

### Overview
Classified microarray samples as Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) or Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) using a support vector classifier (SVC) on a small subset of the normalized intensity values of 7,129 genes from microarray samples generated by Golub, et al.
Final model scored a mean accuracy of 0.95 with 5-fold cross validation on the training set and correctly classified all samples with an accuracy of 1 on the test set.

### Language
Python

### Packages Used
numpy, pandas, scipy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn

### Feature Selection
Reduced 7,129 features to <15 features for classification
- generated metrics on each gene/feature (i.e. t-test p-values, mutual information scores) 
- filtered features based on chosen threshold values for metrics
- generated correlation matrix on remaining features
- eliminated features correlated above threshold, keeping features with lower p-value metric

### Model
Support Vector Classifier

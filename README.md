# Project: Microarray Leukemia Classification

### Overview
Classified microarray samples as Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) or Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) using a support vector classifier (SVC) on a small subset of the normalized intensity values of 7,129 genes from microarray samples generated by Golub, et al.
Final model scored a mean accuracy of 0.946 with 5-fold cross validation on the training set and correctly classified all samples with an accuracy of 0.882 on the test set.

### Language
Python

### Packages Used
numpy, pandas, scipy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn

### Feature Selection
Reduced 7,129 features to ~5 features for classification
- generated metrics on each gene/feature (i.e. t-test p-values, mutual information scores) 
- filtered features based on chosen threshold values for metrics
- generated correlation matrix on remaining features
- eliminated features correlated above threshold, keeping features with lower p-value or mutual information metric

### Model
Support Vector Classifier

### Data Observations
- The histogram of p-values for each gene indicates a high number of differentially expressed genes. Adjusted p-values obtained by permutation of the samples 
resulted in a slightly larger number of genes with low p-values, but the overall distribution appeared unchanged.
- Estimated ~52% of genes differentially expressed
- Although a final feature set of ~5 genes was chosen, the classification results were comparable when some genes in the final feature set were substituted with 
highly correlated alternate genes (those eliminated in the final step of feature selection due to high correlation). 
- Simulation of picking a random 5 genes for classification showed a mean classification score of ~0.62.
- Since many genes are differentially expressed between the ALL and AML groups, the genes in the final model appear to be interchangable with multiple other 
differentially expressed genes for classification.
